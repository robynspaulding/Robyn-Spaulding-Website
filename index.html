						<h2>Robyn Spaulding</h2>
						<h3>Full Stack Software Engineer | Former Educator | Mom</h3>					
					</header>
					<p>Prior to my transition to tech, I worked in education for ten years. I started as a preschool teacher for five years and later worked at a charter high school as a math and English intervention specialist and an after school tutor. And let me tell you, there was never a dull moment in a room full of students, whether you are working with fourteen 2 year olds or a dozen 14-18 year olds. What I love about teaching is seeing students succeed, discovering new ways to teach through research, collaborating with collegues about the best and most engaging ways to present information and compiling and presneting data to demonstrate to students, families and administration the results of their hard work. 
						<p></p>
						After ten years in education, I was lucky enough to spend a year as a stay-at-home Mom. Being a mom is the best, most tiring, worst paid, greatest benefits job I have ever had. When my daughter started preschool, I decided to take on a new challenge and pursue a career in tech. I enrolled at Actualize Coding Bootcamp where I learned coding languages (Ruby and JavaScript), web application frameworks (Ruby on Rails and React) and how to create functional and beautiful websites, both as part of a team and on my own.
						<p></p>
						I fell in love with the process of learning and creating, debugging and problem solving, challenging myself and collaborating with others who love to learn. I discovered that I can use my bakground in research and data analysis/implementation and apply it to my coding journey. I graduated in November and am now looking for an opportunity where I can learn from a great team/mentor, utalize my skills in web development and collaboration to create functional applications and be a part of a community that values growth and positivity.</p>

While looking at all the fun places to visit there is a search bar that accesses a third-party API called SerpApi which scrapes Google results based on your search query and location input. This way users can look up the fun local things to do while they're there without leaving the app!

							<h4>Milestones App</h4>
							<p> This week I started work on a web app that I would like share with my family. It is called
								Milestones and the goal is to have an easy to use front end where a user can: create a secure account,
								login to their home page, add family photos to a general feed, create a family tree with bios and images
								for each family member (relationship to user so that same person can be user A's mom and user B's aunt),
								have seperate profiles for their young children with their bios and images, and the most important
								feature: add their child's developmental milestones (this is where an API will come in to play) to
								showcase each child's growth.This data will be based on early childhood developmental milestones. The
								app will have a check list containing the milestones, a place for a description, the date, and some
								photos. I was not able to find an API that I could access so in the upcoming weeks I hope to create my
								own database to populate the Milestones section of this app. Click the image on the left to see a (very)
								short demo video of how each feature us currently working.</p>

							<h4>Calculator App </h4>
							<p>For this project I followed a great turtorial. My calculator is currently housed on my local server (file:///Users/robynspaulding/Actualize/discovery-projects/calculator-project/calc-html.html) but the learning process was interesting. I struggled at times when coding the JavaScript in the HTML file as each change needed multiple points of coding and I was trying to test functionality before doing all the steps (which obviously didn't work) but I learned that in a project with seperate HTML JS and CSS pages when a change is made it can effect each file and I need to be aware of how they interact when testing. Click on the calculator to see the origional tutorial.
